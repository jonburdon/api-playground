# API Playground

## Project aims
Display data from various different APIs as a way of demonstrating the technology. Fun and informal project, purely to act as a demonstration.

## Developer aims
1. Brush up on using API calls and manipulating arrays, objects and json data in various ways
2. Use a range of libraries at introductory level for charting and mapping
3. Have fun
4. Make a simple game

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript ES6
* Git
* API calls using fetch method

## Approach
In early stages, the same functionality was built in to three different API calls at the same time - ISS, Deck of Cards and Star Wars. This was to reinforce understanding by applying techniques on different systems.

As a fun project, this was not planned too much. The developer moved between back and forth different between different parts of the project.

## Future Plans
1. [ ] Add mapping using leaflet.js https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZaZ2dB6pow
2. [ ] Add graphing with Chart.js https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ptp9tRApM
3. [ ] Develop card games to play with cards from Deck Of Cards API, building up a small collection of reusable js functions
4. [ ] Display cards 1 at a time, so they appear to be places by hand
5. [x] Add api using a key
6. [x] Display weather data
7. [ ] Refactor card game to create Star Wars version
